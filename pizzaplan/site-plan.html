      About the cook

      Jordan Wilson
      Hi! I a sophmore in college and am doing this website for a class asignment.
      I have always loved cooking and have gotten very good at it over the time I have lived away from home.
      My roomate, a really good friend of mine is allergic to dairy. There are several meals that she doesn't have the
      pleasure of including pizza. I decided to create this website to help those who have diet restrictions. I hope you
      enjoy my recipe
      and I hope that the people who have gluten or dairy restirctions will finally have the amazing meal of pizza!
