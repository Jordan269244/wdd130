                <h1> History of Pizza</h1>
                <p>Pizza used to just be flatbread with toppings. It started  with ancient Egpytians, Romans, and the Greeks.</p>
                <p>The idea behind this meal was people wanted a quick easy to eat meal that was filling.</p>
                <p>Today, Pizza is a very popular dish all around the world. Our version of pizza was first done in Italy and soon transfered to America. The first American Pizza place was in New York. Pizza is now 
                  enjoyed by non-Italians and Italinas alike.</p>

                <h2>Why Pizza?</h2>
                <p>My roomate and another close friend in college is allergic to dairy, so hasn't been able to fully
                enjoy several food that we love she can't eat. I wanted to create a recipe for people who can't eat
                dairy and gluten so they can enjoy the incredible meal that is PIZZA.
